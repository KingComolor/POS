Build a fully functional web-based Point of Sale (POS) system called Comolor POS, using Python Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It should include user registration, login, role-based access, business licensing, M-Pesa till integration for payments and receipts, and automatic subscription locking.

🏗️ Core System Features:
1. Multi-Tenant Architecture (PostgreSQL)
Each business/client has its own data scope (tenancy) within the same database.

Use business_id in all relevant tables to isolate client data.

Support dynamic schema OR business-aware models.

Superadmin can access and manage all tenants from a master dashboard.

2. Authentication & Registration
Register: Name, Business Name, Email, Password, Business Type

Must accept Terms and Conditions before registration

Store hashed passwords securely

Login: Email + password

Option to reset password (email-based)

4. License Activation Flow
System must verify M-Pesa payment to a developer-owned Till Number (e.g., 30,000 KES yearly or 3,000 KES monthly).

Once confirmed, activate the account.

Save expiry date in DB; show remaining days on dashboard.

5. License Expiry
Auto-lock access after expiry (Scheduler/CRON).

Notify 5 days before expiry via email/banner.

Option to renew with another M-Pesa payment.

6. M-Pesa Receipts for Business Sales
Every business has a unique M-Pesa paybill/till number saved in settings.

System fetches transactions (via Daraja API or webhook).
